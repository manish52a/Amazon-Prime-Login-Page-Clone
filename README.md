🚀 Amazon Prime Login Page Clone

This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon Prime login page, built using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the visual design and layout of Amazon Prime's login interface to improve my UI/UX skills and better understand how professional websites structure and style their login flows.

    🎯 Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile screens

    🧩 Pixel-perfect alignment with real login form components

    🖌️ Custom fonts, colors, and button styling to match Amazon branding
